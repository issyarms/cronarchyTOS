                <span>
                    I do not do complex backgrounds as I am not confident with backgrounds as a whole. Adding a simple background is at the discretion of the buyer and the result may not be entirely what was expected.

                    ETA of products
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Depending on the complexity of the commisioned item and my general motivation, the time until completion may greatly vary. If there are any significant delays, I will notify the customer.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            All commision types will include a sketch approval stage (and any other consequent stages depending on what was commisioned), at which time I will send any wips to the customer via ko-fi. Until it has been approved, progress will be paused.
                        </li>

                        
                        <li>
                            Upon completion, I will send the customer a full resolution PNG of the commisioned item and the .clip file via Ko-Fi (I will also send via email or Discord upon request)
                        </li>
        
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Revisions 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            At the sketch approval stage, any major changes or revisions must be made at this point; this includes any significant changes to a character's pose or body shape, or redrawing parts of the image.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            If I make any errors in the character design, accessories, or any other visual elements that specified in the provided visual references, I will make these edits at no additional cost.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
